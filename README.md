[rando-CAH](http://avizacherman.net/randocah)

A random humor cards against humanity generator. Made using the same criteria as GA students during project 1 (no back-end, only javascript, HTML and CSS3). Data was taken from http://www.crhallberg.com/cah/json. Built using object-oriented patterns as much as possible.
